# Git Workflow

**NEVER** run `git commit` or `git push` unless the user explicitly asks with words like:
- "commit"
- "push" 
- "commit and push"

Even after completing a task, do NOT automatically commit or push. Wait for the user to request it.

## Version Bumping

When the user asks to commit, **always bump `APP_VERSION` in `version.js`** by 1 before committing. This is the single source of truth for all cache busting (service worker, localStorage caches, HTTP cache). Include `version.js` in the commit.

**NEVER** add manual `?v=N` version numbers to script or link tags. All caching is controlled by `APP_VERSION` in `version.js`.
