# Appointed Times

𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 gives us appointed times, known as 'moed', seasons or feasts of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 (the LORD) during which he meets with mankind. You may be familiar with the spring feast of Passover during which Israel was brought out of slavery in Egypt in 1446 BC and also when Yeshua was crucified as our Passover lamb in 31 AD. Then there are summer feasts of Shavuot and Pentecost and finally the fall feasts where we expect Yeshua to return. These feasts are known as The Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles, and the Last Great Day (of Tabernacles) known as the Atzeret, but commonly translated as solemn assembly.

In order to understand the roadmap of the tribulation and major movements of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 you must learn the timeline of these feasts. It is by understanding His feasts that I identified the Day of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, the Last Great Day, the Atzeret, as October 9th, 2024. If that day arrives as I understand from scripture, then chances are that the following timeline represents the true biblical calendar. Later chapters will provide extensive proofs, but the following is an outline of the key appointed times that you will want to observe as a sign that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is your Elohim (God).

> And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God.
>
> — Ezekiel 20:20

The feasts also contain commands for us to observe and remember, so those seeking to obey the least of His commands do well to understand the days and their meanings.

## New Days

Each calendar day starts at first light and goes until the next first light. First light is about an hour before sunrise. This is contrary to Jewish tradition of sunset to sunset which they inherited from Babylon. The chapter [When Does the Day Start?](/chapters/06-when-does-the-day-start/) dives into the Biblical evidence for this conclusion.

Every day there is supposed to be a morning and evening sacrifice of a lamb by the High Priest. This is not something we can do directly, because we are not priests. That said, we can still offer morning and evening prayers in remembrance of this appointed time.

> I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
>
> — Romans 12

---

## New Months

The month starts in the morning at first light after the night of the full moon. A full moon can be identified as the first day on which the sun sets at or before the full moon rising.

> You shall blow with the New Moon (month) Shofar in the Full Moon for the day of our festival sacrifice.
>
> — Psalms 81:3

This translation of Psalm 81:3 reflects the literal order of the Hebrew words and factors in all of the prefix and suffix letters. Common translations, such as the KJV, substitute "appointed time" for "full moon", but all modern texts such as NKVJ, NASB, and ESV recognize it as the full moon.

By tradition, the phase of the moon all other cultures started the month on was the dark or sliver moon. This is why NASA considers the dark moon the "New Moon" because it was the moon phase at the beginning of the month. That said, there is nothing in scripture I was able to find that contradicts the interpretation of Psalm 81:3 full moon as the start of the month.

If the day of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 arrives on the Atzeret of October 9th, 2024 then you have all the confirmation you need that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 reckons His Holy Days from the full moon. That said, The chapter [When Does the Month Start?](/chapters/07-when-does-the-month-start/) provides further evidence for the full moon so that you may know that He clearly prophesied the day of judgment. All of that said, if things do not come to pass according to my interpretation of scripture, the error is with me and not Him.

The Bible gives specific instructions for the first day of the month which suggests that this day was of greater significance than ordinary days and Sabbaths.

> And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄: Two Bulls, 1 ram, 7 spotless lambs… 1 kid goat, and along with the continual daily offering (1 lamb in the morning and 1 lamb in the evening).
>
> — Numbers 28:11

Yeshua was the ultimate sacrifice for our sins and other sacrifices can only be offered by priests; therefore, these instructions are not for us to follow at this time. Never the less, they still indicate the value 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 placed on the start of the month. At the very least, if you have a Shofar, you can blow it on the daylight after the Full Moon.

> Thus saith the Lord 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
>
> — Ezekiel 46

This verse clearly establishes that there are three kinds of days on 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's calendar: working days, sabbath days, and new moon days. It further establishes that the month starts with the full moon, because scripture compares the sky to a tabernacle.

> …In the heavens/sky He has set a tabernacle for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoices like a strong man to run its race. Its rising is from one end of heaven/sky…
>
> — Psalm 19:4-6

The east gate, or front gate, of the sky is the area where the sun and moon rise, and on the new months the east gate opens for the full moon to rise. Notice that this verse also provides evidence for the day to begin at first light because this is the beginning of the circuit (circle, cycle) of the sun. The sliver moon can only be sighted in the west at sunset.

On New Moons there is no buying or selling:

> When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may offer wheat for sale?
>
> — Amos 8:5

---

## Weekly Sabbaths

Many people are probably familiar with the Sabbath being the 7th day of the week during which everyone is to rest and there is no buying and selling.

> Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
>
> — Exodus 20:8

More broadly, the term Sabbath refers to a week ending in a day of rest. The Hebrew word 'yom' is typically translated as "day", but has many different meanings including:

- daylight, as opposed to night
- 24 hour period
- An abstract division of time, or a period of time
- A year
- A lifetime

With this understanding, a week ending with a daylight of rest could be called a "day" because it is an abstract division of time. With this context it makes sense why Exodus 20 mentions all 7 days. You could therefore translate it as:

> Remember the Sabbath week, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh daylight is a Sabbath to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six daylights 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh daylight. Therefore 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 blessed the Sabbath daylight and made it holy.
>
> — Exodus 20:8 Interpreted

Now that we understand that the Sabbath is a group of 7 days ending in a day of rest, we must ask ourself when does the week start? Some people believe the Sabbath daylight is Saturday, others Sunday, and still others Friday! Scripture gives us some insight:

> And it shall come to pass (after the day of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄), From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me.
>
> — Isaiah 66:23 ESV

Years are divided into months and months are divided into "New Moons" and "Sabbath Weeks" and "Sabbath Weeks" are divided into "6 work days" and "1 rest day". We know that months are not evenly divisible into the year; therefore, there are some years with a 13th month. Likewise, "Sabbath Weeks" are not evenly divisible into some months; therefore, some months have an extra day after the 4th Sabbath week before the next New Moon day. Scripture is silent on the nature of the 13th month and on the 30th day of some months.

Through careful study of scriptures and tests of history I have proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Sabbath is the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th day of each lunar month. On these days there is a half-moon, dark-moon, or full moon. The chapter [When is the Sabbath?](/chapters/10-when-is-the-sabbath/) is dedicated to proving this out.

> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons (moed/feasts/appointed times), and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night with the stars. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.
>
> — Genesis 1:14-18

We know that the sun, moon, and stars are for signs and appointed times and we also know that the Sabbath is a sign and appointed time; therefore it makes sense that the Sabbath should be governed by the sun, moon and stars.

> Therefore the children of Israel (and those grafted in) shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever.
>
> — Zechariah 14

With the Sabbath days connected to the phases of the moon, we have a clear sign for our appointed times with 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 that cannot be corrupted by the tradition of men. The traditional continuous weekly cycle has a number of contradictions and ambiguous situations that make it a logical impossibility. For starters, if you count your days as the number of sunrises you observe, with the Sabbath starting every 7th sunrise, then two people leaving the Garden of Eden in opposite directions (one eastward, one westward) will meet on the opposite side of the globe and will forever disagree about what day is the Sabbath. With a Full Moon Lunar Sabbath any disagreement would be resolved at the start of the next month and if traveling at historical speeds, before trains and air planes, they would be synced up before they even met.

A benefit of the Full Moon Lunar Sabbath understanding is that there are never any conflicts between the weekly Sabbath and other appointed times. Sabbaths are days of rest, healing, and coming together to read the Bible. It would be challenging to keep the Sabbath on Preparation Day for Passover which involved a lot of work. The chapter [When is the Sabbath?](/chapters/10-when-is-the-sabbath/) provides the extensive proofs that this is the true Sabbath.

Yeshua and Paul both had a custom of teaching in the synagogs on the Sabbath. I blow the shofar in the morning to announce it and in the evening to close it while avoiding buying, selling, and chores. To remind myself to avoid work and relax, I wear pajamas. Do not fall into the trap of the Pharisees which added traditions of men that prohibited travel, war, fasting, gleaning grain, and healing on the sabbath.

## New Years

The first month of the year begins on the daylight after the first full moon after the spring equinox.

> And 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, this month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
>
> — Exodus 12

> Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God: for in the month of Abib 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.
>
> — Deuteronomy 16

The word "Abib" means fresh, young barley ears which means the first month of the year begins in the spring. This is critical because the first fruits of barley are waived on the 16th day of the first month. The spring Equinox is March 20th from 2024 through 2032. Because there are an average of 29.5 days per month, there are only 354 days in a Lunar year. This means that on some years the 12th month will end before the Equinox, and in those years there is a 13th month. This occurs an average of 8 out of 19 years.

## Passover

The feast of Passover and Unleavened bread is a remembrance of two of the most important events in biblical history: the Exodus of Egypt and the crucifixion and resurrection of Yeshua. From the evening of the 14th until the evening of the 21st you shall eat unleavened bread. More specifically, no leaven should be found anywhere in the homes of the people and community.

We no longer have priests to kill a Passover lamb and Yeshua was the final Passover lamb to be offered as a sacrifice for sin. That said, it is still possible for us to eat lamb and unleavened bread as a memorial. On the 13th of the month is the Last Supper which we were instructed to "do in remembrance of him".

> For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me." And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.
>
> — Luke 22:18-20

> Tell the whole congregation of Israel that on the 10th day of this month each man must select a lamb for his family, one per household…You must keep it until the 14th day of the month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will slaughter the animals at between noon and sunset (about 3 PM).
>
> — Exodus 12:3,6

---

## Unleavened Bread

> The Passover to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 begins at twilight on the 14th day of the first month. On the 15th day of the same month begins the Feast of Unleavened Bread to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. For 7 days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly; you are not to do any regular work. For 7 days you are to present an offering made by fire to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. On the 7th day there shall be a holy convocation; you must not do any regular work.
>
> — Leviticus 23:5-8

> Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly (Atzeret) to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.
>
> — Deuteronomy 16:8

---

## First Fruits of Barley

> And 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When ye shall enter into the land which I give you, and reap the harvest of it, then shall ye bring a sheaf, the first-fruits of your harvest, to the priest; and he shall lift up the sheaf before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, to be accepted for you. On the [to]morrow of the first day [of Unleavened Bread] the priest shall lift it up.
>
> — Leviticus 23:9-14 Septuagint

> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath [week] starting the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
>
> — Leviticus 23:15

The text of Leviticus appears to point to the 16th in two different ways. First it says it is the day after the Sabbath, second it references the day the sheaf was offered, which we know was the 16th. I added the implied [week] to clarify that the "sabbath day/period of time" likely refers to 6 work days followed by a sabbath daylight, and not a single calendar day, as we discussed earlier. This interpretation is confirmed by Jewish historian Philo from Alexandria, Egypt around the time of Yeshua.

> The solemn assembly (Atzeret) on the occasion of the festival of the sheaf having such great privileges, is the prelude to another festival of still greater importance; for from this day the fiftieth day (Shavout) is reckoned.
>
> — Philo Special Laws II, XXX

Since the Passover Atzeret is on the 7th day of Unleavened bread, we have historical evidence that the Jews interpreted "the morrow after the sabbath starting the sheaf wave offering" to be after the 21st of the month rather than starting on the 16th, which is what would be implied if "sabbath" was interpreted as a single day rather than 7 days.

Next, we have evidence from Biblical history that First Fruits was on the 16th day of the month.

> And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. And they did eat of the old grain of the land on the morrow after the passover (1st day of Unleavened Bread), unleavened cakes, and parched grain in the selfsame day. And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old grain of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
>
> — Joshua 5:10–12

The book of Joshua documents that they ate of the land on first fruits of Barley which is the 16th of the month. We can confirm this interpretation with the writings of Josephus. Josephus and Philo aren't scripture, but are a great second or third witnesses.

> But on the second day of unleavened bread, which is the 16th day of the month, they first partake of the fruits of the earth, for before that day they do not touch them.
>
> — Josephus

We are also told that Yeshua was the first fruits of those who slept, or risen from the dead. This clearly implies that Yeshua rose on the 16th day, which was the 3rd day after he was killed as our Passover lamb on the afternoon of the 14th day of the month.

> But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.
>
> — 1 Corinthians 15:20

---

## Shavuot - First Fruits of Wheat

> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths [weeks] shall be complete: Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄.
>
> — Leviticus 23:15-17

We know that the seven "sabbaths" is talking about units of "weeks" because this is also called the "feast of weeks".

> And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of (beginning from) the first fruits of wheat harvest, and [going to] the feast of harvest at the year's end (cycle). Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, the God of Israel.
>
> — Exodus 34:22

Upon doing a closer study of the Hebrew, the word for "first fruits" has a 'yod' suffix which indicates "beginning of" and implied going to the harvest at the cycles end, which is the first fruits of oil. The very next verse lets us know that there are three first fruits celebrations in this period. Combined with the first fruits of Barley there are a total of four first fruit harvests: barley, wheat, wine, and oil.

> All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, them have I given thee.
>
> — Numbers 18:12

> Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.
>
> — 2 Chronicles 2:15

> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
>
> — Revelation 6:6

> And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
>
> — Joel 2:24

> Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
>
> — Jeremiah 31:12

> And thou shalt eat before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe (first fruits) of thy wheat, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God always.
>
> — Deuteronomy 14:23

> For she did not know that I gave her wheat, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal (false god, meaning lord).
>
> — Hosea 2:8

As you can see, wheat, wine, and oil are used together throughout the Bible and are associated with the first fruits which we are to give to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. Each of these first fruits is separated by seven complete sabbaths (weeks), starting after the first week after Unleavened Bread.

## Pentecost - First Fruits of Wine

This feast is the least well known by traditional Christian and Jewish teaching, but once you study the scriptures it becomes a secret hidden in plain sight.

> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting…. Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. … But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
>
> — Acts 2

When they Holy Spirit came down on Pentecost they were accused of being drunk on New Wine, which is only available when grapes are freshly harvested at the end of July. Peter's defense is even more telling, because by law you could not partake of New Wine until after the First Fruits were offered and they were offered at the 3rd hour of the day (about 9 AM).

We can connect Pentecost to the worship of the Golden Calf by comparing 3000 killed to the 3000 saved. The timeline of Exodus has the Golden Calf incident occur at least 50 days after they arrived at Mount Sinai on the 3rd day of the 3rd month. That would line up perfectly for the 9th day of the 5th month.

> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell (died) of the people that day about 3000 men.
>
> — Exodus 32:28

> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about 3000 souls.
>
> — Acts 2:41

Historically, this is a tragic day for the Jews because both the first and second temple were destroyed on the 9th of Av, which we now know to be Pentecost. After I had independently discovered that Yeshua was born on the 9th of Av I learned that Jewish tradition expects the Messiah to be born on this date.

---

## Christmas in July

Most Christians celebrate the birth of Yeshua on the birthday of the pagan sun gods, December 25th. If you wish to celebrate his Birthday then Pentecost is the proper time to do so. We are not to worship 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 in the same way that the pagans worshiped their gods. This is what happened when Moses came down the mountain with the 10 commandments and found them having a "feast to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄" where they worshiped 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 via golden calf.

> And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄.
>
> — Exodus 32:4-5

Clearly, worshiping 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 on the "sun gods" birthday is similar to having a feast to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 celebrated with a golden calf.

---

## Trumpets - First Fruits of Oil

The Feast of Trumpets is often associated with Rosh Hashanah (the head of the year) and the first fruits of new Oil. This is the time of year when Olives are ripe. Not much is known about how to celebrate this, but from Nehemiah it appears they gathered and read the scriptures.

> Then 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spoke to Moses, saying, "Speak to the children of Israel, saying: 'In the 7th month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a sabbath-rest, a memorial of blowing (shouting) of trumpets, a holy convocation.
>
> — Leviticus 23:23-24

> When the 7th month came, the children of Israel were in their cities. Now all the people gathered together as one man in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate; and they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 had commanded Israel. So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who could hear with understanding on the first day of the 7th month. Then he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
>
> — Nehemiah 8

> This day is holy unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
>
> — Nehemiah 8:9

Many people expect the Feast of Trumpets to be the rapture, but on the day of the rapture he comforts those who mourn. Since Nehemiah had to instruct the people not to cry, we should assume that on this day we also should not cry.

> And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work. For you it is a day of blowing the trumpets. You shall offer a burnt offering as a sweet aroma to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄.
>
> — Numbers 29:1-6

> On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be a reminder of you before your God: I am 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God.
>
> — Numbers 10:10

Considering Feast of Trumpets always falls on a New Moon (full moon) day, we should also blow the trumpets along with the shouting. This day also serves as a 10 day warning for the Day of Atonement, which is a day of Judgment.

---

## Day of Atonement

The day of Atonement is considered a day of judgment and the 10 days leading up to it are traditionally focused on examining our lives and repenting of our sins. When the day of atonement arrives we discover whether 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 accepted us or not. This is the only feast day where we are expected to fast from the evening of the 9th day to the evening of the 10th day. It is also a sabbath day of rest where there is no buying or selling. It is on this day that our sins may be forgiven and every seven years we are commanded to forgive all debts to those in the body of Yeshua.

> And 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spake unto Moses, saying, Also on the 10th day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. And whatsoever soul it be that does any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at evening, from even unto evening, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

> — Leviticus 23:27

> And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself: And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: And he shall put the incense upon the fire before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not: And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
>
> — Leviticus 16:11-14

Because Yeshua is our High Priest and He is not guilty of any sin, this part of the Day of Atonement is no longer necessary. Going forward Yeshua makes Atonement for our sins using his own blood.

> Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness. And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel. And he shall go out unto the altar that is before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
>
> — Leviticus 16:15-19

### The Scapegoat

> And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
>
> — Leviticus 16:20-22

Yeshua is our "scape goat" and we put our sins on him and he takes them away. After we confess our sins we are commanded to be baptized and this is a reflection of the instructions given to the priests on the Day of Atonement.

> And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people. And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
>
> — Leviticus 16:23-26

> And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that lives among you: For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.
>
> — Leviticus 16:29-31

It is on the Day of Atonement on the 49th year of the cycle that we proclaim liberty (freedom from debts) throughout all of the land and consecrate the 50th year, the first year of the next jubilee cycle.

> Then you shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make the trumpet to sound throughout all your land. And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family. That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of its own accord, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine.
>
> — Leviticus 25:9-11

It was on the Day of Atonement that Yeshua went to Nazareth, opened the scriptures, and read Isaiah 61. He then proclaimed it fulfilled in his hearing.

> The Spirit of the Lord 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings (news, the forgiveness of debts) unto the meek (poor, in debt); he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives (indebted), and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.
>
> — Isaiah 61:1-3

When Yeshua read it he stopped just before "and the day of vengeance of our God." That day will be proclaimed on the Day of Atonement in the last year of 70 jubilees, September 28th, 2024.

> On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation. You shall afflict your souls; you shall not do any work. You shall present a burnt offering to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 as a sweet aroma: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year. Be sure they are without blemish.
>
> — Numbers 29:7-11

> At the end of every seven years (On the Day of Atonement) you must cancel debts. This is the manner of remission: Every creditor shall cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor. He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother, because 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's time of release has been proclaimed. You may collect something from a foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you.
>
> — Deuteronomy 15:1-3

Notice the the debts are only canceled among those in Israel and Israel is who we are grafted into as the body of Yeshua. The foreigner are those outside the body of Yeshua. It is only by the blood of Yeshua that we obtain forgiveness of sins and our resulting debt to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. This day is one of the most anticipated days for 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's people.

## Tabernacles

The next feast is known as the Feast of Tabernacles, or the Feast of Nations. It starts on the 15th day of the 7th month. This is a week long feast where people were people dwell in temporary structures (tents) and expected to allocate a sizable portion of their income to this celebration so that both the rich and poor could celebrate in the feast. Traditionally people would travel to Jerusalem for this feast, but now we honor it in spirit and truth wherever we find ourselves.

Every seventh year the entire book of the law, the first five books of the Bible, is to be read in the hearing of everyone during the Feast of Tabernacles. This means Tabernacles 2024 and Tabernacles 2031 should do this.

> And 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄.
>
> — Leviticus 23:33-36

> Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath. And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God seven days. And ye shall keep it a feast unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths (tents), when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God.
>
> — Leviticus 23:39-43

> And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, and unto all the elders of Israel. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, When all Israel is come to appear before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God, and observe to do all the words of this law.
>
> — Deuteronomy 31:9-12

> And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. And they found written in the law which 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month: And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
>
> — Nehemiah 8:13-18

The feast of tabernacles is not just for the past. The Prophet Hosea declares that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 will make us dwell in booths again in the future.

> And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.
>
> — Hosea 12:9

> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
>
> — Zechariah 14:16-19

## Atzeret - Last Great Day

The Atzeret always falls on the 22nd day of the 7th month and is considered the 8th day of Tabernacles which starts on the 15th day. The Atzeret is the last feast day on the Biblical year.

The true calendar of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 has been hidden in the scriptures and I believe modern Jews have given us a tradition inherited Pharisees in which there is no profit.

> It is the glory of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 to conceal a matter and the glory of kings to search it out.
>
> — Proverbs 25:2

> O 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
>
> — Jeremiah 16:19

---

## Hanukkah

Hanukkah, the Festival of Dedication, commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. It is celebrated for 8 days beginning on the 25th day of the 9th month and continuing through the 2nd day of the 10th month.

> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
>
> — John 10:22-23

---

## Purim

Purim commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people from Haman's plot to destroy them, as recorded in the Book of Esther. It is celebrated on the 14th and 15th days of the 12th month.

> Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
>
> — Esther 9:19

## The First Statute Given Moses

The very first command or statute given to Moses was:

> And 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you…
>
> — Exodus 12

> Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 thy God…And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks… and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
>
> — Deuteronomy 16

The first statute mentioned in Deuteronomy 16 is observing the month of Abib which means we must know when that month begins and ends if we are to walk in it as a sign that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is our God.

> But I said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers'.
>
> — Ezekiel 20

So the question one must ask is what were the statutes of their fathers that they are not to walk in?

> Ancient Egyptians started their lunar months when the waning moon disappeared just before dawn.
>
> — Google AI & Wikipedia

Here is what we know. Every ancient culture from Babylon to Egypt to China had a calendar that started the month on the dark or sliver moon. This is a tradition of the entire world! The question is, did the whole world happen to follow 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's calendar, or did the Jewish people get coerced or otherwise corrupted to follow the world's calendar? How could we even determine which is true? Were "some of the statutes" of our fathers, such as their Egyptian calendar months "Ok" and others "not ok"? If so how could we tell?

Right off the bat, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 addresses the calendar and gives them an instruction about the start of the year and it is in this context they were told not to walk in the statues of their fathers, which could include the calendar, of Egypt.

## Pressure to Conform to Pagan Calendar Systems

Anyone who has ever attempted to keep a Full Moon Lunar Sabbath or celebrate Holy Days on dates different from everyone else knows the extreme pressure to conform, even in a "free" society where you are not threatened with violence for observing a different calendar.

Now imagine your town was overthrown and half of its population was carried away as slaves and an entire new generation or two was born and raised. You would be a minority in a culture that uses a different calendar.

You can imagine the pressure to conform, potentially under threat to your life. An entire generation of children would have no memory of prior ways of doing things just like people have no memory of a gold standard or life before income tax!

This is the context of the Jewish people after they returned from exile in Egypt and Babylon. Some people would clearly study history and prophets from 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 would speak to them and guide them until about 400 years BC, so at least some of the population could know and follow the true calendar and the rest would follow the tradition they grew up with, assuming there was a difference.

> O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
>
> — Jeremiah 16:19

Once again we have the Bible warning us that in the last days people would return to 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's ways from the ends of the earth and shall say "surely our fathers have inherited lies".

Daniel tells us that among those lies from the spirit of antichrist are changing the times and the law.

> He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law.
>
> — Daniel 12:25

This is a major Red flag that the anti-christ seeks to change 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's law, especially the calendar.

> This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and which is already in the world at this time.
>
> — 1 John 4:3

Given this reality, we know that everything having to deal with the calendar is shrouded with deception and that the majority will be deceived. This means extra diligence must be given to all studies of calendar related things.

The first trap we must be careful to avoid is what I call "reactionary" mindless behavior of doing the opposite just because it is the opposite. Basically, knowing the times are corrupted and changed doesn't actually tell us what the truth is, only that Satan's goal is to deceive, coerce, or otherwise hide the truth from as many people as possible and that he will be successful against our fathers.

This means that all "tradition" must be rejected as evidence for a calendar. It doesn't automatically mean all "tradition" is wrong, only that arguments built upon it are potentially building upon the lies we were warned that we would inherit from our fathers. In effect, scripture tells us that "tradition" carries no useful positive information and if anything, it is more likely to be wrong than correct. Basically, it can be supporting evidence, but not proof in itself of what the calendar is not.

We must identify an alternative approach to discovering the truth rather than assuming our fathers properly interpreted and maintained it through thousands of years of exile and dispersion because the Bible explicitly tells us we cannot trust the teachings we inherit.

## Map vs Territory

Before going forward we must get a clear understanding of the difference between the map and the territory or actual land. There are an infinite number of maps, but only one territory or physical reality. Proving a map existed 2000 years ago does not prove that it was accurate or even that it was in use. We can prove many different maps existed and they all disagree with each other.

A calendar is a map of time and the physical reality is 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's appointed times. If you want to test a map, you must go out into the physical world and see if the map accurately directs you to your destination.

If you want to test a calendar, we must know with near certainty that a particular point in time was one of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's appointed times and we must know this without a direct or indirect circular reference back to an assumed calendar. Just because your map says the treasure is buried under the X, doesn't mean the X is in the right place. Instead we must first find some treasure, then see what maps have an X in the right place.

---

## Scripture & The Calendar

The first thing you will discover when searching for the scriptural evidence that the month starts with with the dark or sliver moon is that everyone references books outside the cannon. The book of Enoch, Jubilees, or Sirach are examples. This opens up a broader debate about whether these books are indeed "flawless scripture" or merely commentary on scripture or even writings of false prophets? However, if they contradict the canonical scriptures then they cannot be trusted for doctrine. In other words, these extra-biblical books could be just another source documenting the tradition of men we were warned to avoid.

If canonical scriptures didn't say anything about the moon, then we have no basis to judge or test these extra-biblical books to know whether what they are adding is consistent with known scripture. But if the scriptures do provide even a hint of evidence in a different direction, then we start to have an argument that these non-canonical books are clearly not scripture. So while extra-biblical books can be useful confirmation of concepts proven by canonical scriptures, they cannot be relied upon to introduce new doctrines such as calendars.

It is my contention that the calendar is such a critical key to understanding prophecy and knowing Him and his laws and statutes that His calendar will be imbedded implicitly throughout the canonical text in a way that is hard to corrupt.

Consider for a moment if the scriptures were too overt in describing the calendar, then the enemy would have a very easy target to corrupt with the change of a word or two. But if the scriptures capture evidence of the calendar indirectly then it wouldn't be an obvious target to corrupt.

So those advocating the sliver or dark moon who admit right out of the gate that they have little to no conical evidence for a sliver or dark moon have already conceded the point. I am going to present an abundance of verses from the cannon that support a full moon. This leaves a high burden for Enoch, Jubilees, and Sirach to overcome to be considered scripture that doesn't contradict the cannon.

All of that said, because dark and sliver mooners rely on tradition and other works, it might be a case that they just haven't dug deep enough to find the evidence in the cannon. This is a wake up call to stop being lazy regarding relying on tradition and start looking for real evidence and avoiding logical fallacies.

## Evidence for Full Moon

Genesis 1:14 tells us that the sun, moon, and stars are the basis of the calendar.

> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons (moed), and for days, and years.
>
> — Genesis 1:14

It then goes on to tell us about the two great lights which have authority or dominion. The Sun, over the day, and the Moon over the night with the stars.

> The light the greater to rule with the day, and the light the lessor to rule with the night and the stars.
>
> — Genesis 1:16

Many translations list the stars as an afterthought, but the Hebrew clearly establishes that the moon rules with the combination of the night and the stars. In other words, the sun has authority to define the day and the moon in combination with the stars has authority at night. This authority is directly related to their purpose for signs and appointed times and days and years.

This already eliminates using the dark moon, the "no moon", as a sign for when the month starts because it isn't a light. Furthermore, there can be up to 2 or 3 days where no moon is visible; therefore by observation alone it isn't possible to know which of those days starts the month. Modern Jews keep a calendar that doesn't even look at the moon and is entirely pre-determined based upon the dark conjunction similar to ancient Egypt's months.

What this tells us is that they are knowingly following a tradition that goes against the Bible and their own prior tradition simply because it is more convenient to keep their more recent tradition. Their own historical records document that they were forced to stop their tradition of looking for the moon and adopt a fixed calendar. But once they regained their freedom, most didn't go back to the old ways. If we have this proven example of modern Jews knowingly abandoning what they used to believe the scriptures taught and failing to return once persecution ended then we have evidence that this kind of behavior could easily have occurred when leaving Egypt and Babylon. In other words they love the modern tradition of men more than the word of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 and more than their ancient tradition.

One major clue that they adopted the Babylonian calendar is that they adopted the Babylonian names for the months. If they borrowed names that include reference to foreign gods like Tammuz then what other aspects of the Babylonian calendar did they adopt?

### Authority with the Stars

The sliver moon does not rule the night with the stars because the sliver sets during sunset, long before the constellation that the moon is present in becomes visible. The sunset in which the sliver moon is visible washes out all stars. After all, the sliver moon is located next to the sun and while the light of the sun is still washing out the western sky. The only "stars" visible at sunset are usually Mercury and Venus and only occasionally are they visible with the moon.

The 12 main constellations are often referred to as 12 gates that divide the sky. This is known as the Hebrew Mazzaroth.

> Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven (night sky, abode of stars)? canst thou set the dominion (rule) thereof in the earth?
>
> — Job 38:31–33

According to Strongs Exhaustive Concordance, the Hebrew definition of "Mazzaroth" is a plural form of constellations, which in Greek are called the zodiac.

Taken together, we can reasonably assume that the moon only has authority when ruling all night with the Mazzaroth. This fits a full moon perspective because on the full moon it rises in the east at the same time the sun sets in the west and is then is out all night. Furthermore, Genesis 1:16 says "And God made two great (big) lights". The full moon and the sun have the same great size in the night sky and are indeed great lights; however, the first visible crescent is so hard to spot that tradition required two witnesses to verify. This is hardly a "great light" to serve as a sign to start a month.

On the the other hand, the full moon is observed by having the sun set at the same time the moon rises. This produces two infallible witnesses in the sky.

### Synchronizing The Hemispheres

One problem with the sliver moon is that there are often over 24 hours difference between when the first visible sliver can be seen in the Northern and Southern hemisphere. This becomes obvious at the extreme of the North and South poles where the 24 hour of darkness during part of the year means the sliver isn't visible because the sliver is only visible when the moon is near the sun. Meanwhile, other phases of the moon can be visible in broad daylight.

At more moderate latitudes this difference in visibility between the northern and southern hemispheres can cause two people at the same longitude to be on different calendar days because the sliver is visible for such a short period of time in a given night that it could easily be below the horizon or too close to the sun, but on a full moon calendar northern and southern hemispheres are synchronized by longitude in all regions that have at least some short period of darkness every night which is the majority of habitable earth.

### Marking the Feast Days

Some will claim that the full moon is a sign that marks the Feast days; however, that would only apply to two days out of the year and ignores the fact that feast days are defined by counting from the start of the month not by looking at the moon. If you have to wait until half way through the month to know if you are on the right day then you have a major problem.

An even bigger problem is that there is no objective definition of what is technically visible. This means that every town could come to a different consensus or two witnesses could collude and lie. Before speed of light communication it would be impossible to coordinate with a central authority. The very idea of a central global authority runs in the same kind of rebellion as the Tower of Babel because it would be a small group of men in authority telling all of mankind 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's appointed times.

### The Pearly Gates & Location of the Sign

> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run a race His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it.
>
> — Psalms 19

So here we have the sun starting its race in the east at sunrise. Where it rises is compared to the door or gate of a chamber from which it runs its cycle from beginning to end. This could also be interpreted as evidence for the day starting at sunrise.

> Thus saith the Lord 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon (month) it shall be opened.
>
> — Ezekiel 46:1

The sky has already been compared to a Tabernacle in Psalm 19 and Ezekiel tells us the gate of the tabernacle facing east shall be opened in the day of the New Month. It is only opened if something is supposed to come through it!

This verse could easily imply that we must look to the east for the sign of the new month. The sliver moon rises in the east just before the sun on the day before the dark conjunction, like the Egyptian calendar, but once again it is so close to the stars that it lacks authority.

The full moon rises in the east at the start of the night and reigns all night having full authority.

> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl.
>
> — Revelation 21:21

Given there are 12 gates and 12 constellations, and constellations are compared to gates or divisions of the sky it is not unreasonable to make a connection between a full moon and a pearl.

The sun rises in the east, beginning the daylight. The gate looking east is to be opened on the start of the new month. And the word "east" also means to begin or go in front of.

This would suggest that we should be looking to the East for signs in the sun, moon, and stars of when things begin. But Pharisee tradition has everyone looking to the West for when things begin.

In order to see the first sliver you must look West at sunset. In order to see the "start" of the Pharisee day you must look "West" for sunset. Yet another bit of evidence for the day beginning at sunrise.

> Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the [east/front] gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. But the one who enters by the [east/front] gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper (watchmen) opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.
>
> — John 10:1

> I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.
>
> — Revelation 22:16

The Morning Star, Venus, is seen in the East at sunrise.

> Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
>
> — Ezekiel 46:12

He is our Prince and he comes through the East Gate. From this perspective, anyone looking to enter (or start) by another gate, say the West Gate of sunset and the sliver moon could be compared to a thief.

> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
>
> — Psalms 81:3 ESV

> Blow the trumpet at the time of the New Moon, At the full moon, on our solemn feast day.
>
> — Psalms 81:3 New King James Version

> Sound the ram's horn at the New Moon, and at the full moon on the day of our Feast.
>
> — Psalms 81:3 Berean Standard Bible

> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast day.
>
> — Psalms 81:3 NASB

The text is pretty clear in implying the new moon is the full moon, but this is so incongruent with people following tradition of men that they torture the text, add words, re-order words, and redefine words to make it mean something, anything, that allows them to rationalize their tradition.

Some people will claim "full moon" means "covered moon" as in covered in darkness instead of covered in light. By that theory the sliver moon is ruled out because it is neither covered in darkness nor light. Others introduce the word "and", which isn't found in the text, to imply that trumpets should be blown on both the new moon and the full moon and then assume the feast day is on the full moon in the middle of the month; however, the word for "feast day" applies equally to the New Month celebrations as it does to Passover or other celebrations so it is unable to disambiguate by ruling out the New Month feast.

Others will attempt to link this verse to the context of many verses later that refers to Egypt, but then forget that the first ordnance given coming out of Egypt was the start of the New Month at the start of the year.

For all of this effort at manipulating the English translation to fit the dark or sliver moon, a closer look at the Hebrew clearly shows that even the traditional English translations that already imply the full moon have failed to render it as strongly as the Hebrew declares when translated literally, in order, and accounting for all prefix/suffix characters and without adding words.

**You shall blow with the New Moon Shofar in the full moon for the day of our festival sacrifice.**

### Traveling by Full Moon

Some people have presented the case that surely Moses wouldn't lead everyone out of Egypt at night without a full moon to travel by! They then imply that this is evidence that Passover occurs on the full moon.

> In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same (3rd) day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
>
> — Exodus 19

This verse can be interpreted as having them travel on the 3rd day of the month. Which, by the logic above, would imply that the start of the month was the full moon. There are some who maintain that "same day" means the 15th, but that is debunked by other scriptures that document the timing of Shavuot as counted with 7 complete Sabbaths from First Fruits.

> And in the third month from the children of Israel's departure from Egypt, on the sixth day thereof, the Lord gave to Israel the ten commandments on Mount Sinai.
>
> — Jasher 82:6

Even though Jasher isn't cannon, it provides a witness that "same day" likely means 3rd day, something that is also established in the cannon by less direct means.

Furthermore, we know that Ezra traveled at the start of the month and arrived at the start of the month and he didn't have the benefit of a pillar of fire to light the way.

> For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him.
>
> — Ezra 7:9

So if we assume travel by the full moon light, then we have several verses that clearly place traveling at the start of the month. Consider also that many people had to travel several days to arrive at Passover and Unleavened bread. Holding a feast day, where no travel is required, on the dark moon reserves the quarter to full moon light to travel home.

## Eclipse at the Cross & The Dog that didn't Bark

The 3 hours of darkness seen around the world at the time of the cross is clearly an appointed time. What is strangely absent from all reports on this darkness is any reference to it occurring on a full moon, a time when eclipses of the sun were known to be impossible. It would be very noteworthy to those whose government job it is to make notes on celestial events if the sun was darkened anywhere near a full moon.

This reminds me of the story from Sherlock Holmes who deduced a criminal's identity because a guard dog failed to bark at the time of the crime, implying that the criminal and the dog's master were one and the same.

Astronomers failed to bark about a darkness people claim occurred around the time of a full moon, but did record an unusually long and dark solar eclipse. Looks like the dog's silence may have given away those trying to frame the full moon as the day of the cross. That said, it may have been noted by someone and we just haven't found it, so absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

### Chinese Records of Cross Eclipse

The Chinese kept detailed and highly accurate records of astrological events. The following quotes were taken from these records which document some very relevant information that aligns perfectly with Passover week in 31 AD and the Full Moon calendar.

> Yin and Yang have mistakenly switched, and the sun and moon were eclipsed. The sins of all the people are now on one man. Pardon is proclaimed to all under heaven.
>
> — History of Latter Han Dynasty, Volume 1, Chronicles of Emperor Guang Wu, 7th year.

> In the day of Gui Hai, the last day of the (3rd) month, there was a solar eclipse. [The emperor] avoided the Throne Room, suspended all military activities and did not handle official business for five days.
>
> — History of Latter Han Dynasty, Vol. 1, Chronicles of Emperor Guang Wu, 7th year.

> Eclipse on the day of Gui Hai, Man from Heaven died.
>
> — History of Latter Han, Annals, №18, Gui Hai.

> During the reign of Emperor Guang Wu, on the day of Bing Yin of the fourth month of Jian Wu, a halo–a rainbow–encircled the sun.
>
> — History of Latter Han, Annals №18, Gui Hai.

A Google search for "Reign of Emperor Guang Wu" will provide a helpful answer:

Guangwudi (born c. 6 bc, Nanyang [now in Hubei province], China — died ad 57, Luoyang) was the Chinese emperor (reigned ad 25–57) who restored the Han dynasty after the usurpation of Wang Mang, a former Han minister who established the Xin dynasty (ad 9–25)

By inclusive counting, the 7th year of Guang Wu is 31 AD. From the earliest records, the beginning of the ancient Chinese year occurred at a New Moon near the winter solstice. The first new moon after the winter Solstice in 30 AD was Jan 11th, and the last day of the 3rd month would have been around April 10th. Here is the list of all eclipses calculated by NASA.

As you can see, the May 10th, 31 AD eclipse is the only eclipse visible in China to occur in the fourth month. There are no eclipses recorded by NASA in the third month of any year during the reign of Emperor Guang Wu. This means the darkness recorded by this record was likely the supernatural eclipse at the cross regardless of any claims of mistranslation of "The sins of all the people are now on one man". Furthermore, it is impossible to have two solar eclipses that are just 1 month apart, but the Chinese records appear to document that happening.

Since we know that the Chinese start their months around the dark phase of the moon and we know they reported the supernatural darkness occurring on the last day of the month, we can conclude that this evidence suggests Passover must have been on the dark phase of the moon and therefore the month must have started on a full moon.

This is an example of using evidence from history without relying upon an argument from tradition. We know the Chinese months in their celestial records started on the dark moon because the same records record the sun, moon, and stars. The records are internally consistent and don't have to make reference to outside traditions.

## Why Didn't Yeshua Correct the Calendar?

Most people will claim that at the time of Yeshua the Jews kept the sliver moon and this is based upon historical records documenting the sliver moon from Josephus to Philo to the Talmud and non-canonical works of Enoch, Jubilees, and Jasher. They also claim the Sabbath was Saturday at this time. This combined with limited records documenting the keeping of the full moon at the time is used to imply that Yeshua must have been killed on a Passover set by a sliver moon.

The first logical fallacy in this argument is the assumption that absence of evidence is evidence of absence. I have just presented a ton of Biblical and astronomical evidence to support a full moon, but historical evidence is sparse. Anyone who has been around archeology knows that secular scholars like to claim the Bible is inaccurate or mistaken or that it even made up people like King David because they could find no historical evidence. Then time after time they eventually find tangible evidence that the Bible was true.

Traditional biblical scholars can make the same mistakes because they are essentially making the exact same argument when they say "They couldn't possibly have kept a full moon based Passover in 31 AD because we don't have any written evidence."

The second fallacy is an assumption that everyone agreed on a single calendar at that time. This is easily debunked by the evidence of Essene calendar found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. At least one sect of Jews kept a different calendar. Throw in variations on the Enoch calendar and we have 3 or 4 different documented calendars. There is also evidence of a Lunar Sabbath calendar starting at a sliver moon from that time and earlier. All of that on top of the Roman calendars. Clearly, there was not universal agreement on a single calendar.

You can view this type of argument like those who claim "All the experts agree" or those who deny the existence of opposition.

A related fallacy is known as "Appeal to a Common Belief" says that most Jews generally accept Saturday as Sabbath and dark or sliver moon as true; therefore it is probably true.

The phrase "New Moon" could be best interpreted as "The Phase of the Moon that Starts the Month"; however, because almost everyone around the world has the tradition of starting the month around the dark moon, even science has adopted the term "New Moon" to mean "dark moon". If, by tradition, the Full Moon was widely adopted as the start of the month, do you really think we would still call the dark phase of the moon the New Moon? It is impossible to separate this tradition from how the phrase "New Moon" got its meaning.

Consider that New Moon has at least "two" meanings as referring to either the sliver or the dark conjunction. If it can have two meanings, then why not more?

### Theory on the Absence of Evidence

My theory, for which I have no direct evidence beyond what is implied by scripture and the stars, is that the Jews in charge of the Temple, those who derived their authority by virtue of being Levites, followed the true calendar of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 until some time after 31 AD. Meanwhile the Pharisees attempted to usurp the divine right of Levite Priests by claiming the authority derived from their status as "experts" at "teaching the law" and other political processes, adopted the Babylonian sliver moon calendar.

When the temple was destroyed in 70 AD all records of the Levite Priests were burned and their authority over the temple was shattered along with any remaining power over the calendar schedule for feast days. This created a power vacuum into which the Pharisees assumed power over teaching and tradition. They naturally destroy or simply fail to preserve any evidence that is contrary to their position or supports the authority of the Levites.

On top of all of this the Spirit of Antichrist was alive and well seeking to change the time and seasons and destroying or persecuting those who followed the true calendar.

### Calendar Dispute with Yeshua's Followers

> Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.
>
> — Colossians 2

While some people take this out of context to justify disregard for His calendar, I believe it is better understood to highlight a division among Jews as to what calendar to follow. The Pharisees could have persecuted or judged those who kept the full moon calendar (or any calendar different than what we have inherited from the Pharisees).

> The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies — I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting. Your New Moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; They are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them.
>
> — Isaiah 1:13–14

Clearly Isaiah is implying that the start of the month was corrupted or prophesying that it will be corrupted and the people were keeping different feasts and sabbaths and not 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄's New Moons.

The Epistle of Barnabas, while not scripture, offers one ancient interpretation of Isaiah:

> Finally, he says to them: "I cannot bear your new moons and sabbaths." You see what he means: it is not the present sabbaths that are acceptable to me.

Granted he had a broader take that the true Sabbath is the 1000 year Sabbath. Never the less, it is easy to interpret Isaiah to say that they changed the Sabbath day.

Taken as a whole, this means all evidence of tradition of Pharisees is more likely evidence (not proof) of what the wrong calendar is. And by process of elimination we are left with the Full Moon start of month being the most likely true calendar which just happens to also be the most strongly supported by canonical scripture and the stars by a wide margin.

## Sabbath Changes and Destruction of Temple in 70 AD

We know at the time of Yeshua via the gospels that people appeared to take keeping the Sabbath very seriously, but imagine that sometime after the cross political pressure to conform with other calendars from either or both Romans and the Pharisees caused the Levites to change their official calendar? People would be keeping a false Sabbath just as religiously but end up doing work on the true Sabbath leading to the destruction of the temple.

> Thus says 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄: "Take heed to yourselves, … hallow the Sabbath day (week), as I commanded your fathers. But they did not obey nor incline their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear nor receive instruction.
>
> "And it shall be, if you heed Me carefully," says 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, "to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but hallow the Sabbath day, to do no work in it, then shall enter the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, accompanied by the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain forever.
>
> "But if you will not heed Me to hallow the Sabbath day, …, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
>
> — Jeremiah 17:27

Since the temple and Jerusalem were destroyed, we can conclude that the Jews did not heed 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 and lost track of the Sabbath. Following the Pharisee Tradition risks Survivorship Bias because the anti-christ spirit didn't shoot it down. The Jews may have systematically moved to a false Sabbath and forgot the true Sabbath meaning there would be little trace of the true Sabbath left by the time the temple was destroyed.
