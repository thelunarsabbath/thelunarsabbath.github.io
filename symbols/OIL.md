# OIL — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Works |
| **Two Words** | Proven Works |
| **Sentence** | Works that have been tested and proven through trials—as oil is produced by pressing/crushing olives (fruit of the covenant tree), so proven works result from tested faithfulness |

**Opposite**: Untested / Unproven

## The Key: Trace the Origin

**How is oil made?**
1. OLIVES (fruit) from OLIVE TREES
2. Olives are PRESSED/CRUSHED
3. OIL is extracted

**Symbolic chain:**
- OLIVE TREE = Israel/Covenant Community (Romans 11)
- OLIVES = Works (FRUIT = Works)
- PRESSING = Trials/Testing
- OIL = **Proven Works**

## Why OIL ≠ Spirit

**Matthew 25:9** — "go **buy**" oil
**Acts 8:20** — Spirit **cannot be purchased**

The Spirit is a gift. Oil can be "bought" (acquired through effort).

Therefore: OIL = something you can acquire = **Proven Works**

## Parable of Ten Virgins

- **Wise** had oil = had proven works, reserves of tested faithfulness
- **Foolish** had no oil = had not built up proven works
- Cannot borrow = cannot use someone else's track record

## Gethsemane = "Oil Press"

Jesus was "pressed" in the garden of the Oil Press before crucifixion — the ultimate test producing the ultimate proven work.

## Production Chain

| Oil | Proven Works |

## Summary

**OIL** = **PROVEN WORKS**

Not the Spirit (which is a gift), but works that have been tested through trials. This is why you can "buy" it and why the foolish virgins couldn't borrow it.
