# H6256 עֵת — "The Times" Word Study

## The Word

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Strong's | Meaning |
|--------|----------------|----------|---------|
| עֵת | *'eth* | H6256 | time, appointed time, season |

Derived from H5703 עַד (*'ad*, perpetuity, forever) — suggesting not just any moment, but a time with **duration and purpose**. A season with boundaries, an appointed period.

The word appears in **258 verses** in the Old Testament. Usually without the definite article — just "a time," "the time of," etc.

But in exactly **[13](/reader/numbers/13) verses**, the definite article הַ is added: **הָעֵת** or **הָעִתִּים** — "**THE** time" / "**THE** times." This is significant in two ways. First, Hebrew uses the definite article to point to something **specific and previously known** — not generic time, but THE appointed time. Second, the number [13 symbolizes rebellion](/reader/numbers/13) — the appointed times are marked by rebellion against God's established order (Genesis 14:4, the thirteenth year of rebellion). THE times are the epochs where rebellion reaches its appointed conclusion.

## The Definite Article Pattern

Out of 258 uses of עֵת, only 13 have the definite article. Every one of them refers to a **specific, predetermined, or prophetically significant moment** — never to vague or ordinary time.

### הָעִתִּים — "THE Times" (Plural, with article) — 4 occurrences

These are the rarest form: the plural with the definite article. Only 4 verses in all of Scripture:

**1 Chronicles 29:30** — THE times that passed over David and the nations
> "With all his reign and his might, and **the times** that went over him, and over Israel, and over **all the kingdoms** of the countries."

These are not casual days. These are the **sweeping eras** — the rise and fall of kingdoms, the prophetic epochs of David's reign. The definite article marks them as **the specific ages** known to God.

**Esther 1:13** — The wise men who "knew THE times"
> "Then the king said to the wise men, which **knew the times** — for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment."

These advisors were not weather forecasters. They were **discerners of appointed seasons** — those who understood the prophetic calendar, the cycles of kingdoms, the times decreed by heaven. "Knowing THE times" is a specific skill: reading God's prophetic clock.

**Daniel 9:25** — In tribulation, THE times
> "...the plaza and the moat. And in tribulation, **the times**."

The only use of הָעִתִּים in a prophetic context about the end. Paired with צוֹק (*tsoq*, anguish/tribulation), this is not "troublous times" as if describing difficult construction conditions. It is **THE times** — the same appointed seasons that the wise men of Esther discerned, the same epochs that passed over David and the kingdoms.

**Daniel 11:13** — After THE times and years
> "For the king of the north shall return... and shall certainly come after **the times**, years, with a great army."

Again in Daniel, THE times refers to **specific predetermined intervals** between prophetic events — not vague periods.

### Pattern: הָעִתִּים always means appointed prophetic epochs

| Verse | Context | THE times = |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 Chronicles 29:30 | David's reign summary | The eras of kingdoms |
| Esther 1:13 | Wise men who "knew" them | The prophetic calendar |
| Daniel 9:25 | In tribulation | The appointed end |
| Daniel 11:13 | Between prophetic events | Predetermined intervals |

### הָעֵת — "THE Time" (Singular, with article) — 9 occurrences

The singular form with the article also points to specific, known moments:

**Ezekiel 7:7, 12** — "THE time is come"
> "The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: **the time** is come, the day of trouble is near" (7:7)
> "**The time** is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for **wrath** is upon all the multitude thereof" (7:12)

THE time of judgment. THE specific appointed hour. Not "a difficult period" — the day of the Lord.

**Daniel 12:1** — "At THAT time"
> "And at **that time** shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be **a time of trouble, such as never was** since there was a nation."

THE time of the end — the great tribulation. Daniel 12:1 explicitly links הָעֵת to the unprecedented tribulation and Michael's arising. This is the same prophetic clock as Daniel 9:25.

**Genesis 31:10** — At THE time the cattle conceived
> "And it came to pass at **the time** that the cattle conceived..."

Even in a pastoral context, the article marks a **specific divinely orchestrated moment** — the time God showed Jacob the vision.

## What This Means for Daniel 9:25

The traditional rendering "even in troublous times" treats הָעִתִּים as a vague description of Nehemiah's building difficulties. But every other occurrence of הָעִתִּים in Scripture refers to **prophetic epochs, appointed seasons, and the rise and fall of kingdoms**.

Daniel himself uses הָעֵת / הָעִתִּים in three passages (9:25, 11:13, 12:1) — and in the other two it unmistakably means predetermined prophetic intervals. Why would the same author, in the same prophetic book, suddenly use the definite article to mean "generic hard times"?

The definite article is a signal: **"the times"** — the specific prophetic calendar that the wise discern (Esther 1:13), the epochs of kingdoms (1 Chronicles 29:30), the appointed end (Daniel 12:1).

In Daniel 9:25, "in tribulation, **the times**" is not a footnote about construction difficulty. It is a statement about **where on the prophetic timeline** the events fall — in the tribulation that marks the appointed times.
